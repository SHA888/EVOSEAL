		{
			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Setup Development Environment and Project Structure",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the setup of the development environment and project structure into subtasks covering repository creation, directory scaffolding, configuration management, dependency setup, logging, and documentation.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves multiple standard but essential setup activities (repo, config, dependencies, logging, docs). While not algorithmically complex, it requires attention to detail and coordination across several areas, making it moderately complex. Each area can be a subtask for clarity and parallelization."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Base Integration Layer",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the implementation of the base integration layer into subtasks for WorkflowEngine class development, JSON schema definition, schema validation utilities, communication patterns, error handling, and integration tests.",
			"reasoning": "This task introduces architectural complexity by defining interfaces, schemas, and error handling for cross-component communication. It requires careful design to ensure extensibility and robustness, and involves both code and protocol design."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Minimal Data Models",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose the creation of minimal data models into subtasks for each model (Code Archive, Evaluation Results, System Configuration), serialization utilities, and Git-compatible storage functions.",
			"reasoning": "While the models themselves are straightforward, ensuring serialization, validation, and compatibility with Git adds moderate complexity. Each model and utility can be a focused subtask."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Implement DGM Core Components",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the DGM core implementation into subtasks for EvolutionManager, AgenticSystem, LLMInterface, prompt template creation, integration with data models, and unit/integration testing.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves multiple interacting classes, LLM integration, and orchestration logic. The need for prompt engineering and robust testing increases the complexity above basic model implementation."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Implement OpenEvolve Core Components",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down OpenEvolve core implementation into subtasks for Controller, Evaluator, TestRunner, VersionDatabase, CLI, selection algorithm, and integration testing.",
			"reasoning": "OpenEvolve covers several core classes, evaluation logic, storage, and a CLI. The selection and evaluation logic, plus the need for robust storage and retrieval, make this a moderately high complexity task."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Implement SEAL (Self-Adapting Language Models) Basic Components",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand SEAL (Self-Adapting Language Models) implementation into subtasks for FewShotLearner, KnowledgeBase, SelfEditor, knowledge/example loading, and integration with LLM.",
			"reasoning": "SEAL (Self-Adapting Language Models) involves implementing learning and self-editing logic, but the algorithms are relatively contained. The main complexity comes from integrating with LLMs and managing examples/knowledge."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Version Control Integration",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose version control integration into subtasks for GitInterface, VersionManager, repository operations (clone/open/pull/commit/push), file operations, structure extraction, and error handling.",
			"reasoning": "Integrating with Git and managing code versions programmatically is moderately complex, especially when handling edge cases and ensuring robust file operations."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Test Execution Framework",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the test execution framework into subtasks for TestRunner, MetricsTracker, ImprovementValidator, test environment setup/teardown, metrics calculation, comparison logic, and integration testing.",
			"reasoning": "This task requires orchestrating test execution, metrics tracking, and validation logic. Handling test environments and result analysis adds to the complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Basic Evolution Pipeline",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the evolution pipeline into subtasks for EvolutionPipeline class, WorkflowCoordinator, CLI, component integration (DGM, OpenEvolve, SEAL (Self-Adapting Language Models), version control, testing), event handling, end-to-end workflow, and error handling.",
			"reasoning": "This is a high-complexity integration task, requiring coordination of all major components, workflow orchestration, and robust error/event handling. It is the backbone of the system and must ensure seamless operation across modules."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Foundational Safety & Validation",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand foundational safety and validation into subtasks for CheckpointManager, RollbackManager, RegressionDetector, checkpoint creation/restoration, rollback logic, regression detection, pipeline enhancement, and safety testing.",
			"reasoning": "This task introduces advanced safety mechanisms, rollback, and regression detection, all of which require careful design and integration with the evolution pipeline. Ensuring reliability and recovery in failure scenarios is highly complex."
