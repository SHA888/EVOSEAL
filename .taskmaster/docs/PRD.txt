# Overview
EVOSEAL is an advanced AI agent designed to solve complex programming tasks through code evolution while continuously improving its own architecture. It represents a significant advancement in autonomous AI systems for code generation and optimization by combining three key technologies (SEAL, OpenEvolve, and DGM) into an integrated, self-improving system.

The system addresses the challenge of creating AI systems that can not only solve programming problems but also autonomously enhance their own capabilities over time. This self-improvement cycle is particularly valuable for researchers, AI developers, and organizations working on complex coding projects that require continuous refinement and adaptation.

# System Design Considerations

## Complexity Management
- **Version Compatibility**: Implement semantic versioning with a compatibility matrix in `configs/compatibility.yaml` to track component versions and ensure compatibility during self-modification

- **Modular Architecture**: Encapsulate each component with well-defined boundaries to allow individual evolution without cascading changes

## Evaluation Framework
- **Multi-Metric Balancing**: Implement weighted scoring defined in `configs/evaluation_weights.yaml` to balance correctness (highest weight), efficiency, and readability, with user-adjustable weights
- **Anti-Gaming Protections**: Include diverse test suites covering edge cases, randomized test generation to prevent overfitting, secondary validation using different methods, and human review prompts at configurable checkpoints

## Safety Mechanisms
- **Regression Testing**: Implement comprehensive test suites to verify that new solutions and self-modifications maintain or improve functionality
- **Immutable Core**: Designate critical safety systems as "immutable" in `configs/safety.yaml` to prevent self-modification
- **Safety Boundaries**: Define explicit constraints in `configs/constraints.yaml` for permissible action space to prevent drift from objectives
- **Versioned Rollbacks**: Track all architecture changes with Git to allow immediate rollback to previous stable versions

## Computational Efficiency
- **Performance Profiling**: Track computational overhead of self-improvement vs. task solving in `metrics/performance_log.json` (currently averaging 30% of total computation)
- **Resource Allocation**: Control API request rates, model selection, and parallel processing options via `configs/resources.yaml`
- **Caching Mechanisms**: Implement extensive caching with cache invalidation strategies based on change magnitude

## Convergence Behavior
- **Diminishing Returns Detection**: Track improvement magnitudes to adjust self-improvement frequency when returns diminish below configurable threshold
- **Time Horizon Evaluation**: Assess long-term impact of architectural changes through simulation over multiple future tasks
- **Stability Metrics**: Measure convergence stability using statistical methods to identify oscillations and divergence patterns

## Scalability Considerations
- **Task Complexity Scaling**: Track performance across task complexities in `metrics/complexity_scaling.json` with adjustable strategies
- **Domain Adaptation**: Include transfer learning mechanisms that leverage knowledge from previously solved tasks
- **Architectural Flexibility**: Allow self-improvements to introduce new approaches when existing methods prove insufficient

## Implementation Approaches
- **API Design**: Use RESTful interfaces with standardized JSON schemas for independent evolution with compatibility
- **Database Optimization**: Implement indexing optimizations and pruning strategies for large numbers of program variants
- **Monitoring**: Provide comprehensive logging and visualization tools for system behavior insights

## Research and Benchmarking
- **Baseline Comparisons**: Ongoing benchmarking shows 15-45% improvement over non-evolutionary methods across standard programming tasks
- **Failure Recovery**: Implement two-phase recovery: immediate rollback to last stable version and diagnosis mode
- **Human Oversight**: Require periodic human review at configurable checkpoints, with plans to reduce supervision
- **Resource Management**: Balance computation between task solving and self-improvement based on task urgency and expected improvement
