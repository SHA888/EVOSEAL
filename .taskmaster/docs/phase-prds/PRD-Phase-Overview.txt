# EVOSEAL Development Phases Overview

## Introduction
This document provides a high-level overview of the EVOSEAL development phases, explaining the progression from MVP to full system capabilities. Each phase builds upon the previous one, ensuring a logical and manageable development process that aligns with the task-master workflow.

## Phase Structure

### Phase 1: MVP Core Foundation
**Focus**: Establishing the minimal viable product with core integration between DGM, OpenEvolve, and SEAL.
**Timeline**: 8 weeks
**Key Outcomes**:
- Functional integration between all three components
- Basic evolution pipeline from generation to evaluation
- Essential safety mechanisms and validation
- Capability to solve simple programming tasks

### Phase 2: Enhancement & Advanced Features
**Focus**: Expanding system capabilities with more sophisticated features and improved integration.
**Timeline**: 14 weeks
**Key Outcomes**:
- Advanced component integration with better communication
- Enhanced evolution strategies and evaluation metrics
- Comprehensive safety and validation mechanisms
- Improved user interface and monitoring tools
- Capability to handle moderately complex programming tasks

### Phase 3: Full System Capabilities & Self-Improvement
**Focus**: Implementing true autonomous self-improvement with advanced features and scaling.
**Timeline**: 18 weeks
**Key Outcomes**:
- Real-time learning and continuous adaptation
- Architecture self-improvement mechanisms
- Extended benchmark support across diverse tasks
- Enhanced safety protocols for self-modifying code
- Distributed evolution across multiple compute nodes
- Human feedback integration for guided improvement
- Capability to handle complex programming tasks across domains

## Development Process

For each phase, follow the task-master workflow:

1. **Task Planning**
   ```
   task-master parse-prd --input=.taskmaster/docs/phase-prds/PRD-Phase-X.txt
   ```

2. **Complexity Analysis**
   ```
   task-master analyze-complexity --research
   task-master complexity-report
   ```

3. **Task Breakdown**
   ```
   task-master expand --id=<id> --research
   ```

4. **Implementation**
   - Select tasks based on dependencies, priority, and ID order
   - Implement following task details and project standards
   - Verify tasks according to test strategies

5. **Task Completion**
   ```
   task-master set-status --id=<id> --status=done
   ```

6. **Phase Transition**
   - Ensure all phase success metrics are met
   - Review and document lessons learned
   - Update tasks.json for next phase
   ```
   task-master generate
   ```

## Dependency Structure

Phase progression follows a strict dependency chain:
- Phase 1 (MVP) must be completed before beginning Phase 2
- Phase 2 must be completed before beginning Phase 3

Within each phase, follow the logical dependency chain outlined in the respective PRD.

## Resource Allocation

Resources should be planned according to phase requirements, with increasing needs as the project progresses:
- **Phase 1**: Basic development resources
- **Phase 2**: Medium compute resources with limited GPU acceleration
- **Phase 3**: Full distributed computing resources with dedicated GPU nodes

## Success Criteria

A phase is considered complete when:
1. All specified deliverables are implemented
2. All success metrics are met
3. Comprehensive tests pass
4. Documentation is updated
5. Code quality meets project standards
